## How to:
Create an empty object and attach a script to it.
##
After you're done with the object open the script and follow the example code given in the two .cs files attached to the repository.
##
Once you're done setting up the script, set values for the spawning array and then attach the needed objects to the main object which contains the script. Example: The weapon script should contain a "Size" value which defines the size of the weapon spawning array, after you give it a size you attach the objects of the different types of weapons that your game will use.
